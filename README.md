# LabChain-documentation
This repository hosts the documentation of the LabChain project

As the data of the LabChain project is hosted on the [Energy Data Market platform](https://viaduct-ui-windnode-dev.okd.fokus.fraunhofer.de/datasets?lang=en&catalog=uni-leipzig) in the catalogue of Leipzig University, the semantic data does not contain semantics of the respective constructs within the data. This limitation is rectified by describing the structure and meaning of the JSON-files related with the research employing the LabChain system within this repository.

The repository is furthermore intended to document the LabChain code components that are not covered in the core repository.
